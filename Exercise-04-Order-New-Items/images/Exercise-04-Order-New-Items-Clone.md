# Exercise 04 - Order New Items

In our scenario, Franck will need to determine which products to add to his inventory based on the feedback received on the wishlist. To do this, he will need to review the wishlist voting and comments received from his colleagues and the companyâ€™s customers through a customer portal. Franck will also need to view the existing product inventory from the on-premise backend system. Once he has decided which products to order, he will need to be able to place an order on the backend system and update the backend system inventory accordingly.

To simulate our on premise backend system, we will deploy a simple Java application which exposes product related backend APIs via OData services based on Apache Olingo Java libraries.

We will use Web IDE Full-Stack to modify our existing wishlist application to include the retreival of data from the backed system as well as from the data stored in the SAP HANA database from the wishlist application.

**This exercise involves the following main steps.**

1.	   Deploy product backend OData service.
2.	   Configure the SAP Cloud Connector: Add Cloud Platform Subaccount add local backend). Configure subaccount and access OData URL.
3.    Clone the Wishlist application from Git
4. 	Build and Deploy application to SAP Cloud Platform
5.	   Create Destination configuration on SAP Cloud Platform
6. 	Test the application


## 1. Deploy Product Backend OData Service

We first need to deploy a pre-built Java application which will simulate our backend system. The OData service will exposes product information that can be consumed by our wishlist application.

1. Tomcat bundle is available in the TechEd student image under D:\Files\Session\OPP363\apache-tomcat-9.0.11
2. Navigate to the bin folder
3. Double Click on  startup.bat file. (this will launch a command prompt and start the tomcat server).
4. Launch the URL [http://localhost:8080/backend-odata/Product.svc](http://localhost:8080/backend-odata/Product.svc).

![backend odata](Exercise2_1_backend_odata.JPG)

5. Notice that the OData service exposes a collection called OnPremiseProductData. Append `/OnPremiseProductData` to the URL so you have [http://localhost:8080/backend-odata/Product.svc/OnPremiseProductData](http://localhost:8080/backend-odata/Product.svc/OnPremiseProductData).

![backend odata](Exercise2_2_backend_odata_collection.JPG)

## 2. Configure the SAP Cloud Connector
The Cloud Connector is an optional on-premise component that is needed to integrate on-demand applications with customer backend services and is the counterpart of SAP Cloud Platform Connectivity. We will download the Cloud Connector from the SAP development tools site. We will use the portable version of the SAP Cloud Connector as it can be easily installed by simply extracting a compressed archive into an empty directory. It does not require administrator or root privileges for the installation.
1. Before we install and configure the SAP Cloud Connector, we will need to get our Subaccount ID for use during the configuration of the cloud connector.
2. Login to your SAP Cloud Platform cockpit [TechEd 2018](https://account.hana.ondemand.com/cockpit#/globalaccount/8fd39023-a237-4d71-9b6a-ed9d1719d275/subaccounts)
3. Click the ![i_link](Exercise2_ilink.jpeg) link on the Cloud Foundry subaccount tile (OPP363CF).

![account id](Exercise2_3_CF_account_id.JPG)

4. The subaccount ID (`dabec0d5-6df7-495d-9c96-f6b25dfd78a4`) will be displayed. Keep this subaccount ID for use in the cloud connector configuration.

![account id](Exercise2_4_CF_account_id.JPG)

5. Locate the SAP Cloud Connector folder on the TechEd Image `(D:\SAP\SCC20)`
6. Double-click `go.bat` to start the SAP Cloud Connector.
7. Launch SAP Cloud Connector URL [https://localhost:8443](https://localhost:8443) and login with the credentials:
   - User: `Administrator`
   - Password: `welcome`
8. For _Define Subaccount_ enter the following configuration:
   - Region Host: `cf.eu10.hana.ondemand.com`
   - Subaccount: `<ID that you copied in step 4>`
   - Display Name: `ProductData Connector`
   - Login Email ID: `<your_login_email>`
   - Password: `<Your_Password>`
   - Location ID: `OPP363-XX` (XX being your unique number assigned to you)
   - Description: `ProductData Connector`

Ignore the fields under the section HTTPS Proxy on the right side, leave them blank 

![add subaccount](Exercise2_5_cc_add_subaccount.JPG)

For the current hands-on, all participants are sharing a single SAP Cloud Platform subaccount. To disambiguate the SAP Cloud Connector, each participants provides a unique Location ID.

Location IDs are defined to identify a location of a cloud connector for a specific sub account. You can have multiple SAP Cloud Connectors configured to work with a single sub account identified by unique Location IDs

9. Click _Save_.
10. Ensure that the Status under Tunnel Information is Connected. If you receive an error, recheck your Region, Subaccount and login information.

![add subaccount](Exercise2_6_cc_subaccount_status.JPG)

11. Now that we have configured the SAP Cloud Connector and connected it from our local laptop to our SAP Cloud Platform account, the next thing we need to do is to configure access to the backend system.
12. In the SAP Cloud Connector UI, go to `Cloud To On-Premise` from the left-hand menu.
13. Click the `+` icon to add a new mapping virtual to internal system.

![add mapping](Exercise2_7_cloud_to_onprem.JPG)

14. Choose Back-end Type as `Non-SAP System` and click _Next_.
15. Choose Protocol as `HTTP` and click on _Next_.
16. For Internal Host, enter:
    - Internal Host: `localhost`
    - Internal Port: `8080`
17.	Click _Next_.
18.	For Virtual Host, enter:
    - Virtual Host: `productbackend.com`
    - Virtual Port: `8080`
19.	Click Next.
20.	Leave Principal Type as `None` and click _Next_.
21. Enter a Description and click _Next_.
22. In the Summary Screen check the `Check Internal Host` check box and click _Finish_.

![summary](Exercise2_8_summary.JPG)

23. You should notice that the Check Results column says `Reachable` in Green.

![check results](Exercise2_9_check_results.JPG)

24. `Under Resources Accessible On productbackend.com:8080` section, click the `+` icon to add the resources under this system.
25. Enter `/backend-odata/` under URL Path.
26. Select the option `Path and all Sub paths`.

![check results](Exercise2_10_add_resource.JPG)

27. Click _Save_.
28. You should notice that the Status is Green.
29. If it is not green, recheck the value for URL Path.

This completes the configuration of the SAP Cloud Connector.
