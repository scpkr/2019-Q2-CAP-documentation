# Overview

In our scenario, Franck wants to determine which products to add to his inventory. To do this, he needs to review the votes and comments received via the Wishlist app from his colleagues and the companyâ€™s customers through a customer portal.

Franck also needs to view the existing product inventory from the on-premise backend system. Once he has decided which products to order, he will place an order on the backend system and update the backend system inventory accordingly.

To simulate our on premise backend system, we will deploy a simple Java application which exposes product information via an OData service.  To create this OData service, we will create a service based on Apache Olingo Java libraries.

We will use Web IDE to modify our existing wishlist application so that it in addition to the data stored in the SAP HANA database, it also displays data from our simulated backend system.

# 1. Setting up On-Prem Data

In the previous exercise we did the needful for the data that is stored in a HANA DB on SAP Cloud Platform. We now need to access the On-Prem Data.

In the interest of time and the prominence of the topic, the presenter has already set-up the on-premise system for your consumption. In the next section we will see, what has the presenter done already.

However, if you wish to setup your own On-prem system running on your machine, you may refer to the [this documentation](./On-Premise-Setup.md). Once you complete the steps mentioned in the aforementioned document you can proceed with from [Step 3](#3-enhance-the-service-for-the-wishlist-application)

# 2. Test access to the On-Prem Data

1. To test if the On-Prem system is up and running, please launch the following URL:
   ```url
   https://teched2018-opp363-opp363-space-245-srv.cfapps.eu10.hana.ondemand.com/odata/v2/CatalogService/BackEndProductData
   ```

   If the on-premise system is running (on the presenter's system), you should see the data from on-prem.

   ![backend odata](images/Exercise2_0_onprem_data_success.png)

   If you see the following image, please ask the presenter to start the On-Premise system.

   ![backend odata](images/Exercise2_0_onprem_data_fail.png)


2. In your SAP Cloud Platform Cockpit, go to TechEd2018 &rarr; OPP363CF &rarr; Connectivity &rarr; Destinations

![backend odata](images/Exercise2_0_onprem_dest.png)

Note: Pressing the ***Check Connection*** button will incorrectly state that your backend system cannot be reached.  Please ignore this error.

# 3. Enhance the Service for the Wishlist Application

Using Web IDE, we can now enhance the service module of our existing wishlist application to include data from our simulated premise system.

1. In Web IDE, open your existing `furnitureshop` application.
2. Under the `db` folder, edit the file `data-model.cds` by **replacing the entire content of the file with the following**

    ```javascript
    namespace com.company.furnitureshop;

    entity Wishlist {
      key ProductID        : String;
          categoryName     : String;
          productName      : String;
          productDesc      : String;
          productColor     : String;
          productWidth     : Integer;
          productHeight    : Integer;
          productDepth     : Integer;
          productWeight    : Integer;
          productPrice     : Decimal(10,2);
          productWarranty  : Integer;
          materialType     : String;
          supplierID       : String;
          supplierName     : String;
          supplierLocation : String;
          pictureURL       : String;
          productRating    : Decimal(3,2);
    }

    entity BackEndProductData {
      key ProductID    : String;
          SUPPLIERID   : String;
          SUPPLIERNAME : String;
          PRICE        : String;
          STOCK        : String;
          DELIVERYDATE : String;
          DISCOUNT     : String;
    }
    ```

    We have now extended our data model to include the metadata of a table that exists in our backend system - ***not*** in our HANA database.

    As you save the `data-model.cds` file, think about the consequences of that last statement.

3. Under the `srv` folder, edit the file `cat-service.cds` by **replacing the entire content of the file with the following**

    ```javascript
    using com.company.furnitureshop from '../db/data-model';

    service CatalogService {
      entity Wishlist @read @update as projection on furnitureshop.Wishlist;

      @cds.persistence.skip
      entity BackEndProductData as projection on furnitureshop.BackEndProductData;
    }
    ```

    The purpose of the `@cds.persistence.skip` annotation it to tell the CDS compiler that following entity does ***not*** need to be created as a table in the HANA database.

    Think about why this annotation is needed...

    Where does the backend product data come from?  Our HANA database, or somewhere else?

    When we modified `data-model.cds`, we explicitly include the metadata of a table that we know does not exist in our HANA database, but instead, exists in an independent, backend service running on our local laptop.  Therefore, it is necessary to do two things:

    * Modify the data model to include the definition of entity `BackEndProductData`
    * Modify the service to expose this new entity as part of the OData service, yet at the same time, explicitly exclude this entity from being created in the HANA database.  This is because the data comes from an alternative source that we must now define.

    Save the `cat-service.cds` file

1.	Since the entity `BackendProductData` is exposed as part of the OData service, yet it does not exist in the HANA database, unless we implement how this data should be retrieved, any OData `GET` operations on this entity will always return an empty collection. Therefore, the `Query` and `Read` operations against the `BackendProductData` entity must be supplied by a custom implementation in Java.

    This custom implementation will read the OData service provided by the service running in our local Tomcat server. In order to access that local Tomcat server, we will make use of the virtual URL exposed by the SAP Cloud Connector.  So the confoguration in our SAP Cloud Connector acts as the connectivity bridge between apps running in the cloud and data available from on-premise system (or in our case, the laptop)

1.	Under the `srv` folder, navigate to `src/main/java/com/company/furnitureshop`

    Right-click on the `furnitureshop` folder name and choose _New -> Java Class_.

    Enter the class name `BackEndProductEntity`

    ***IMPORTANT***
    Do not add a `.java` extension to the class name as Web IDE will do this for you

    You don't need to modify the package name.

    **Replace** the code in the file with the code below:

    ```java
    package com.company.furnitureshop;

    import com.sap.cloud.sdk.result.ElementName;
    import com.sap.cloud.sdk.service.prov.api.annotations.Key;

    public class BackEndProductEntity {
      @ElementName("ProductID")
      @Key
      private String ProductID;

      @ElementName("SUPPLIERID")
      private String SUPPLIERID;

      @ElementName("SUPPLIERNAME")
      private String SUPPLIERNAME;

      @ElementName("PRICE")
      private Float PRICE;

      @ElementName("STOCK")
      private String STOCK;

      @ElementName("DELIVERYDATE")
      private String DELIVERYDATE;

      @ElementName("DISCOUNT")
      private String DISCOUNT;

      public String getPRODUCTID() {
        return ProductID;
      }

      public void setPRODUCTID(String PRODUCTID) {
        this.ProductID = PRODUCTID;
      }

      public String getSUPPLIERID() {
        return SUPPLIERID;
      }

      public void setSUPPLIERID(String SUPPLIERID) {
        this.SUPPLIERID = SUPPLIERID;
      }

      public String getSUPPLIERNAME() {
        return SUPPLIERNAME;
      }

      public void setSUPPLIERNAME(String SUPPLIERNAME) {
        this.SUPPLIERNAME = SUPPLIERNAME;
      }

      public String getSTOCK() {
        return STOCK;
      }

      public void setSTOCK(String STOCK) {
        this.STOCK = STOCK;
      }

      public String getDELIVERYDATE() {
        return DELIVERYDATE;
      }

      public void setDELIVERYDATE(String DELIVERYDATE) {
        this.DELIVERYDATE = DELIVERYDATE;
      }

      public String getDISCOUNT() {
        return DISCOUNT;
      }

      public void setDISCOUNT(String DISCOUNT) {
        this.DISCOUNT = DISCOUNT;
      }
    }
    ```

    This coding is the Java implementation of the entity definition we just added in `data-model.cds` in which we define the getter and setter methods for `BackEndProductEntity`.

1. In the same folder create another Java class and name it as `BackendService`.

    **Replace** the code in the file with the code below:
    Paste in the code shown below:

    ```java
    package com.company.furnitureshop;

    import java.util.List;
    import java.util.Map;
    import org.slf4j.Logger;
    import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;
    import com.sap.cloud.sdk.service.prov.api.request.QueryRequest;
    import com.sap.cloud.sdk.service.prov.api.request.ReadRequest;
    import com.sap.cloud.sdk.service.prov.api.response.ErrorResponse;
    import com.sap.cloud.sdk.service.prov.api.response.QueryResponse;
    import com.sap.cloud.sdk.service.prov.api.response.ReadResponse;
    import com.sap.cloud.sdk.service.prov.api.operations.Query;
    import com.sap.cloud.sdk.service.prov.api.operations.Read;
    import com.sap.cloud.sdk.odatav2.connectivity.ODataQueryBuilder;
    import com.sap.cloud.sdk.odatav2.connectivity.ODataQueryResult;

    public class BackendService {
      private static final String BACKEND_DESTINATION_NAME = "ONPREM_BACKEND";
      private static final Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(BackendService.class);

      @Query(serviceName = "CatalogService", entity = "BackEndProductData")
      public QueryResponse getProducts(QueryRequest queryRequest) {
        logger.info("Class:BackendService - now in @Query getProducts()");

        QueryResponse queryResponse = null;
        try {
          logger.info("Class:BackendService - now execute query on Products");
          ODataQueryBuilder qb = ODataQueryBuilder.
            withEntity("/backend-odata/Product.svc", "OnPremiseProductData").
            select("ProductID", "SUPPLIERID", "SUPPLIERNAME", "PRICE", "STOCK", "DELIVERYDATE","DISCOUNT");

          logger.info("Class:BackendService - After ODataQueryBuilder: ");
          ODataQueryResult result = qb.enableMetadataCache().
            build().
            execute(BACKEND_DESTINATION_NAME);

          logger.info("Class:BackendService - After calling backend OData V2 service: result: ");

          List<Map<String, Object>> v2BackEndProductsMap = result.asListOfMaps();
          queryResponse = QueryResponse.setSuccess().setData(v2BackEndProductsMap).response();

          return queryResponse;
        }
        catch (Exception e) {
          logger.error("Class:BackendService ==> Exception calling backend OData V2 service for Query of Products: " + e.getMessage());

          ErrorResponse errorResponse = ErrorResponse.getBuilder().
            setMessage("Class:BackendService ==> There is an error.  Check the logs for the details.").setStatusCode(500).
            setCause(e).
            response();
          queryResponse = QueryResponse.setError(errorResponse);
        }

        return queryResponse;
      }

      @Read(entity = "BackEndProductData", serviceName = "CatalogService")
      public ReadResponse getProduct(ReadRequest readRequest) {
        logger.info("Class:BackendService - at Read "+readRequest.getKeys().get("ProductID").toString());
        ReadResponse readResponse = null;

        try {
          logger.info("Class:BackendService - getProduct inside with ProductID = " + readRequest.getKeys().get("ProductID").toString());
          ODataQueryResult readResult = ODataQueryBuilder.
            withEntity("/backend-odata/Product.svc",
              "OnPremiseProductData('" +
              readRequest.getKeys().get("ProductID").toString() +
              "')").
            select("ProductID", "SUPPLIERID", "SUPPLIERNAME", "PRICE", "STOCK", "DELIVERYDATE", "DISCOUNT").
            enableMetadataCache().
            build().
            execute(BACKEND_DESTINATION_NAME);

          BackEndProductEntity readProdEntity = readResult.as(BackEndProductEntity.class);
          readResponse = ReadResponse.setSuccess().setData(readProdEntity).response();

          logger.info("Class:BackendService - After calling backend OData V2 READ service: readResponse : " + readResponse);
        }
        catch (Exception e) {
          logger.error("==> Exception calling backend OData V2 service for READ of Products: " + e.getMessage());

          ErrorResponse errorResponse = ErrorResponse.getBuilder().
            setMessage("There is an error.  Check the logs for the details.").
            setStatusCode(500).
            setCause(e).
            response();
          readResponse = ReadResponse.setError(errorResponse);
        }

        return readResponse;
      }
    }
    ```

    This coding uses the SAP Cloud Platform SDK to implement the OData service exposed by the SAP Cloud Platform, but under the surface, it uses the SAP Cloud Connector connection (via a destination called `ONPREM_BACKEND` *that we haven't created yet*) to call the OData service running in our local Tomcat server.

    The `@Query` annotation implements the query operation for the `BackEndProductData` entity set and the `@Read` annotation for reading a single `BackEndProductData` entity.

2. In the same folder create another Java class and name it as `WishlistHandler`. Replace the contents of file with the code shown below:

    This Java Class handles the Wishlist collection's update method which will be used in the next exercise

    ```java
    package com.company.furnitureshop;

    import org.slf4j.Logger;
    import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;
    import com.sap.cloud.sdk.service.prov.api.operations.Update;
    import com.sap.cloud.sdk.service.prov.api.response.UpdateResponse;
    import com.sap.cloud.sdk.service.prov.api.request.UpdateRequest;
    import com.sap.cloud.sdk.service.prov.api.EntityData;
    import com.sap.cloud.sdk.service.prov.api.ExtensionHelper;
    import com.sap.cloud.sdk.service.prov.api.DataSourceHandler;
    import java.util.Map;
    import java.util.HashMap;
    import java.util.List;
    import java.util.ArrayList;
    import com.sap.cloud.sdk.service.prov.api.response.ErrorResponse;

    public class WishlistHandler {
      private static final Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(WishlistHandler.class.getName());
      @Update(entity = "Wishlist", serviceName = "CatalogService")
      public UpdateResponse updateWishlist(UpdateRequest updateRequest, ExtensionHelper extensionHelper) {

        EntityData entityData = updateRequest.getData();

        Map<String, Object> keyMap = new HashMap<String, Object>();
        keyMap.put("ProductID", entityData.getElementValue("ProductID"));
        DataSourceHandler handler = extensionHelper.getHandler();

        try {
          EntityData existingWishlistData = handler.
            executeRead("Wishlist", keyMap, getWishlistPropertyNames());

          EntityData updatedWishlistData = EntityData.
            getBuilder(existingWishlistData).
            removeElement("productRating").
            addElement("productRating",entityData.getElementValue("productRating")).
            buildEntityData("Wishlist");

          handler.executeUpdate(updatedWishlistData, updateRequest.getKeys(), false);
        }
        catch (Exception e) {
          ErrorResponse err = ErrorResponse.
            getBuilder().
            setMessage("Failed to Update Wishlist. Check log for more details.").
            setStatusCode(500).
            response();

          return UpdateResponse.setError(err);
        }

        return UpdateResponse.setSuccess().response();
      }

      public static List<String> getWishlistPropertyNames() {
        List<String> propertyNames = new ArrayList<String>();

        propertyNames.add("ProductID");
        propertyNames.add("categoryName");
        propertyNames.add("productName");
        propertyNames.add("productDesc");
        propertyNames.add("productColor");
        propertyNames.add("productWidth");
        propertyNames.add("productHeight");
        propertyNames.add("productDepth");
        propertyNames.add("productWeight");
        propertyNames.add("productPrice");
        propertyNames.add("productWarranty");
        propertyNames.add("materialType");
        propertyNames.add("supplierID");
        propertyNames.add("supplierName");
        propertyNames.add("supplierLocation");
        propertyNames.add("pictureURL");
        propertyNames.add("productRating");

        return propertyNames;
      }
    }
    ```

3. Save the file

# 4. Extend the User Interface to Display On-Premise Product Data

We will next extend the user interface both to display the on-premise product data and show the wishlist product ratings. The ratings will be captured in the next exercise.

There are 2 things we need to change in the UI:

* Add a new Tab to show Backend Product Data that we fetch from on-Premise system.
* Update the code to Display Product Ratings.

1. Expand the folder `ui/webapp/view` and open the file `Detail.view.xml`.

    Replace the contents of the file with this [DetailView.xml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SAP/cloud-cf-furnitureshop-demo/step2-order-service/ui/webapp/view/Detail.view.xml) and click on Save

    Here we are making 2 changes:
    1. Adding a new Tab to show the On-Premise data.
    2. Adding a field to show the average customer rating.


2. Now expand the folder `ui/webapp/controller` and open `Detail.controller.js`.

    Replace the contents of the file with this [Detail.controller](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SAP/cloud-cf-furnitureshop-demo/step2-order-service/ui/webapp/controller/Detail.controller.js) and click on Save

    In the Detail controller file, we add the logic to fetch the data used by the UI Elements added in the previous step.

3. Open the `mta.yaml` file in the top-level project folder and replace the contents of `mta.yaml` with this version [mta.yaml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SAP/cloud-cf-furnitureshop-demo/step2-order-service/mta.yaml)

    ![mta_img](images/Exercise2_mta_file.jpg)

    Here we add a property that allows our `srv` server app to expose date through the destinations feature on SAP Cloud Platform.

<a name="Step5"></a>
# 5. Build and Deploy Application to SAP Cloud Platform

We are now ready to build the `furnitureshop` project and deploy it to Cloud Foundry.

1. Now that we have changed both the data model and the service definition, we must rebuild our `CDS files` and `DB Module`.

* CDS File

  Right-click on the `furnitureshop` project name and select _Build -> Build CDS_.

    ![Build Project](images/Exercise2_build_cds.png)

    In the console, confirm that the CDS compiler gave a zero return code.

* DB Mobule:

  Right-click on the `db` project name and select _Build -> Build_.

  ![Build Project](images/Exercise2_build_db.png)

2. Next, delete the DB Instance created on your SAP Cloud Platform Cockpit. As done in [the second step of the clean-up section in Exercise 3](https://github.com/sandeep-tds/cloud-cf-furnitureshop-documentation/tree/master/Exercise-03-Publish-Wishlist#3-clean-up).

3. Right-click on the project name and select _Build -> Build_.

    ![Build Project](images/Exercise2_17_build.png)

    The build process may take a couple of minutes to complete,but when it does, you will see a new folder in your workspace called `mta_archives` within which your new `furnitureship_0.0.1.mtar` file can be found

4. Right-click the `furnitureshop_0.0.1.mtar` file and select _Deploy -> Deploy to SAP Cloud Platform_.

    ![Deploy mtar](images/Exercise2_18_deploy_mtar.png)

5. You may get a popup asking you to enter your credentials, please enter your id/password, then in the _Deploy to SAP Cloud Platform_ dialog, enter:

    - Cloud Foundry API Endpoint: `https://api.cf.eu10.hana.ondemand.com`
    - Organization: `TechEd2018_OPP363`
    - Space: `<your space>`

    ![CF Endpoint](images/Exercise2_19_deploy_mtar_cf_endpoint.JPG)

    Wait until the deployment is complete (this will take several minutes) and ensure it was successful, meanwhile you can login to the cockpit to view the applications being deployed.

    ***IMPORTANT***
    Please do not attempt to run your `furnitureshop` application until the deployment has completed!

6. Once the deployment has completed successfully, in the Applications section of your SAP Cloud Platform cockpit, you will see that three new applications have been deployed: `db`, `srv` and `ui`.

    ![Deploy MTAR file](./images/deployed_mtar.png)

    * `db`
    This is the implementation of your data model.  It was deployed as part of the MTA deployment and will be stopped by default.  Please do not delete or modify this app.

    * `srv`
    This is the service created to expose your data model.  This module has been implemented in Java and was deployed as part of the MTA deployment

    * `ui`
        This is the HTML5 wishlist application containing the UI logic that was deployed as part of the MTA deployment

    You will also see application `webide-builder-sapwebide-di-<some_random_string>`.  This is the CDS builder tool that you installed in Exercise 1. Every time you select "Build CDS" or "Build" from a context menu, you are invoking this tool.  Please ***do not*** delete this application!

    There will also be the application `<some_random_string>furnitureshop-srv` that was created in an earlier exercise.

    **Note** - Please note that the development of Franck's app is still incomplete. To test the app we must first create destinations highlighted in Step 6. Once we create the destinations, we can test the application.


7. Select the `srv` service and make a note of the URL under Application Routes.  This is the URL to start your service and will be needed when we create a destination in the next step.

# 6. Create Destination Configuration on SAP Cloud Platform

Before proceeding with this step, please make sure the deployment is complete.

Next, we need to create an instance of a destination service on the SAP Cloud Platform.  Once the destination service instance has been created, we can configure it to point to our SAP Cloud Connector. This configuration will allow us to access our local Tomcat server that is behaving as if it were an on-premise backend system.

1. In your SAP Cloud Platform admin cockpit, go to your Cloud Foundry sub-account and navigate to your space.

1. Expand Services, then select Service Instances

    ![Service Instances](images/Exercise2_Service_Instances.png)

1. Click on the `destination` service instance, then from the menu on the left, select Destinations

   ![Service Instances](images/Exercise2_Destination_Service_Instances.png)

   ![Service Instances](images/Exercise2_Destinations.png)

2. Click on New Destination and enter the following:

    | Property | Value | Notes |
    |---|---|---|
    | Name | `getWishlist` |
